List of concepts used in this example program:

– project structure: library (lib.rs) with main.rs and some modules (module ~= Class?)
– rustfmt options
– interesting libraries used: clap, ncurses (WTF!), stderrlog, crossbeam
– ?-Operator (merger.rs)
– closures (animator.rs)
– MVC model with (at least one) Trait _Object_
– some use (or non-use) of iterators (board/mod.rs)
– gimmik: non-ascii identifier (animator.rs)
– unsafe rust (for feature comparable to split_at_mut()) (board.rs)
– threads (with crossbeam; mention explicit drop())
– editors used: VS Code, Eclipse
