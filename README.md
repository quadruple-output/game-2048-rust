# game-2048-rust

The game "2048" implemented in the Rust programming language.  It runs in a
text terminal.  For a tolerable UI experience, you should have ncurses
installed.  Run with

```
cargo run -- -d ncurses
```

or

```
cargo run -- --help
```

This was my study-project for learning Rust, so don't expect too much.
