# game-2048-rust
The game "2048" implemented in the Rust programming language

This is my study-project for learning Rust.  Feel free to give any kind of feedback on the code, or create an issue.

I happen to be new to git, as well.  Maybe you will noticeâ€¦

This piece of work is conceptually based on http://git.io/2048
